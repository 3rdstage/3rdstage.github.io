   | `function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)` | Returns the total token supply. |   |
   | `function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)` | Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`. |   |
   | `function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)` | Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event. |   |
   | `function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)` | Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event. |   |
